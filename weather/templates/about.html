<h1>About Weather App</h1>
<hr class="my-4">
<p>Welcome to my minimalist weather app, designed to provide you with clear, instant weather updates wherever you are.
    Built using Django, this app allows you to search any location easily and receive the latest weather data in a
    clean, distraction-free interface. Whether you want to know the temperature before heading out, check if the skies
    are sunny or cloudy, or simply prepare for your day, this app delivers essential weather details without unnecessary
    clutter. With just a quick search, you get real-time updates on the current condition, humidity percentage, and UV
    index, allowing you to plan your activities and clothing choices with confidence.</p>
<p>This app was created as a practical Django project to deepen backend and API integration skills while delivering a
    functional tool for everyday use. The focus was on building a lightweight, responsive system that fetches and
    displays weather information efficiently, ensuring users get fast results with minimal wait times. By leveraging
    Djangoâ€™s structured backend framework, the app ensures data consistency and stability while maintaining an intuitive
    user experience. I hope this app helps you stay informed about your local weather in a simple and effective way as
    I continue to improve and expand its capabilities in future updates.</p>
